# HydraBus console configuration file
# This file must be present in the Root of Hydrabus SD Card. However, its presense is optional.
# If it is not found (or no SD card found for that matter) at startup then only USB1 and USB2
# consoles are spawn as soon as USB bus becomes active (i.e. old 'compatibility' behaviour)
#
# Comments start with #
#
# USB1/USB2 usage: "USB<num>=<status>", where
# num is 1 for USB1 or 2 for USB2;
# status is 1 to enable console or 0 to disable (important if you want to power via USB but don't want to use the console)
#
# USART options: "USART=<status>;<num>;<speed>", where 
# status is 1 to enable console or 0 to disable;
# num is USART number (1,2 or 3)
# speed is speed in bps (make sure you set the speed within Hydrabus USART speed range)
# max speed compatible with Linux non-custom speeds is 4000000 bps (check with stty on your system)
# only one USART console allowed at the moment. Note that each console instance take 4k+ more memory from the heap!
#
# At the moment USART3 is WIP; and USART2 has max tested speed of 2000000 bps.
#
# --- example 1: enable USB2 and USART1 ---
# USB1=0
# USB2=1
# USART=1;1;4000000
#
# --- example 2: enable USB1 and USB2 only ---
# USB1=1
# USB2=1
# USART=0;1;4000000
USB1=1
USB2=0
USART=1;2;2000000
